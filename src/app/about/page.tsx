        <h1>About Portable Blenders Travel Guide</h1>
        <p>We created this independent resource to help travelers, digital nomads, fitness enthusiasts, and busy parents choose reliable portable blenders without wasting money on weak motors or unsafe builds.</p>
        <h2>Our Mission</h2>
        <p>Provide clear, data-backed reviews with real-world usability insights: how many blends per charge, how it handles fibrous greens, leak resistance in backpacks, noise levels in shared spaces, and ease of cleaning on the go.</p>
        <h2>Editorial Integrity</h2>
        <p>Products are either purchased or supplied with no guarantee of a positive verdict. Affiliate links help fund deeper testing and battery life monitoring. We never let brands preview or edit our opinions.</p>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
